# USUM-Competitive-Sets
Ever since USUM leaked, I've been keeping track of the potential/speculated new competitive sets based on the USUM tutor/egg move additions. I've finished creating a database of PK7 files with those sets, and wanted to share it with the community. All of these sets originated in speculation threads on Smogon's OU, UU, and RU boards. Use them as is or as templates, and feel free to change the OT.
